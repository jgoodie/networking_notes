Complete the following steps to set a static IP address.
1. Log in to the device using the default password (the default password is password).
2. Use the ip address command to set the Ethernet IP address.
If you are going to use an IPv4 IP address, enter the IP address in dotted decimal notation. You
should also disable DHCP and enter a gateway address as well.
                     device(config)# interface Management 1/0
                     device(config-Management-1/0)# no ip address dhcp
                     device(config-Management-1/0)# ip address 10.24.85.81/20
To set up a default gateway, add an IP route in RBridge mode.
                     device(config-rbridge-id-10)# vrf mgmt-vrf
                     device (config-vrf-mgmt-vrf)# address-family ipv4 unicast
                     device (vrf-ipv4-unicast)# ip route 0.0.0.0/0 10.24.80.1
                     device (vrf-ipv4-unicast)# exit
                     device (config-vrf-mgmt-vrf)# exit
                     device#(config)# copy running-config startup-config
